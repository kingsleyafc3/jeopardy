	<p>This is a game of jeopardy with a twist. After selecting the category, you have to find hidden pictures. There are 9 pictures per category. Once a picture is found, you can click on it to reveal the questions. You have 20 seconds to answer each question before the page times out. Scoring is upto the user's discretion.</p>
